
lou:
- try (baseline) models with preprocessing
- try further submissions on kaggle (they seem to be quite a bit lower than locally)
- try ensemble models with different models and embeddings
- not available much after 17.July
- introduction part of the report and baseline models!
- some possible baseline models: logistic regression, svm, random forest w tfidf, 
PRIORITY:
- >>>>>>>>>> decide on the baseline models by considering: examples shown on tutorial slides,
			 simpler models we have tried from svm to rnn models,
			 look at typical baseline models in literature


abhinav:
- continue working with bert model, roberta, bertweet
- >>>>>>>>>> lstm with attention promising, try implementing it with preprocessing and do submission on kaggle!
- submit
add following to preprocess.py:
- lemmatization
- hashtag segmentation


ahmet
outliers:
- for future consideration: outlier detection by using ensemble model (possibly lstm combined with others) to determine outliers/wrongly labeled tweets
preprocessing (priority):
- finish testing and debugging of preprocessing
- see if duplicate deletion can be done more efficiently and/or if maybe the whole code can have duplicates removed
- write sample implementation from data loading to preprocessing so we can all have a uniform preprocessing step
- merge preprocessing branch to the main
xlnet (priority):
- start with xlnet text classification


next meeting on monday 11.7.2022, 9:00 - 10:00
