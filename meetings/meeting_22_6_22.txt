lou:
- word2vec with diff. neural networks. with or without pre processing
- try different word embeddings
- max accuracy at the moment about 80%

ahmet:
- 1 week only experimenting on text-gcn
- mainly work on adjacency matrix and leveraging word embeddings for similarity between words

abhinav:
- lstm and rnn with attention models
- different word embeddings

kate:
- preprocessing
- experiment pre processing effectiveness by applying it on our models
