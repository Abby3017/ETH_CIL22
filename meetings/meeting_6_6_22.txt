
meeting notes, 6.6.2022:

Kate:
- working on CNN for text classification
- using word2vec
- base model for now, but might look into more recent CNN models for text/semantic classification

Ahmet:
- apparently written exam was difficult in prior years.
- beware of private leaderboard. don't overfit and keep model general enough so we don't lose points in private leaderboard
- still looking into XLNet and other sophisticated models which could give us state-of-the-art results


General:

- briefly discussed how ensemble models work (train different models and then make prediction based on their results)

- we could fine tune our models on external datasets. preferably twitter. doesn't have to be labeled

- Euler access provided to all students: login with "ssh eth_username@euler.ethz.ch"
- password is same as the one used for mystudies etc.
- get access code on first login
- for this and more info: https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Getting_started_with_clusters
- not sure if we have gpu access
