
meeting notes

models:
- 2 baselines
- novel transformer with diff ensembles
- lstm, cnn, linear baseline logistic regression
- results on github

- predefine split and show results for all on that

ahmet:
- written: kaggle, train test, percentages
# - electra, distilbert
- look at lou's preprocessing

lou:
- try to improve on neural network baseline, dropouts and tanh
- stacked cnn as ensemble
- compare preprocessing and combine them and put results
- random_seed, same for all

kate:
- do preprocessing testing
- all preprocessing steps on different models, baseline and novel

abhinav:
- lstm attention, ensemble models
